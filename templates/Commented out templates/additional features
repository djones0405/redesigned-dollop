To create a notes page that allows the user to sign in, save, delete, and load notes, you will need to implement several features. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

    Create a login page that allows the user to enter their username and password.

    Create a database to store the notes. You can use a database system like SQLite or MySQL to store the notes.

    Create a registration page that allows the user to create a new account. This page should ask for the user's email address, username, and password.

    Create a page that allows the user to view their notes. This page should display a list of all the notes that the user has created.

    Create a page that allows the user to create a new note. This page should have a form that the user can fill out with the note's title and contents.

    Create a page that allows the user to edit a note. This page should display the current title and contents of the note and allow the user to edit them.

    Create a page that allows the user to delete a note. This page should display a list of all the user's notes and allow the user to select one to delete.

    Implement user authentication to ensure that only the user who created a note can view, edit, or delete it.

    Use Flask's session management to keep the user logged in across pages.

    Write the necessary Python code to handle the database interactions, form submissions, and other features.

Keep in mind that these are just general steps and there are many details and decisions to consider when building a notes page. It's important to plan out the features and design of the page carefully before starting to code.
